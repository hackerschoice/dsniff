- finish conversion to buf interface

- rework half-duplex tcp_raw reassembly, for *snarf [-c]

- NTLM handling in telnet, FTP, HTTP, SMB, NNTP, etc. non-trivial
  since dsniff only examines client traffic :-/

- arpspoof [host ...]

- more protocols: atalk, MAPI, etc.?

- reverse more of AOL's OSCAR protocol for dsniff and msgsnarf
